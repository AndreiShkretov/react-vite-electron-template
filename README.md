## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## Running the Project

### SPA (React) Development Server

To run the React app in development mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port) to see the SPA.

---

### Electron Development

To run the Electron app in development mode (build React app and launch Electron):

```bash
yarn electron:dev
```

This command will build the React app and then start Electron pointing to your built files.

---

## Building the Project

### Build React SPA

To build the React app for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

The build output will be located in:

```
dist/
```

### Build Electron Desktop Application

To build the full Electron app including the React frontend:

```bash
yarn electron:build
```

This will build your React app and then package the Electron app using `electron-builder`.

The packaged files and installers will be generated according to your electron-builder configuration (usually in the `dist-electron` or `dist` folders).

---

## Where to Find Build Files

- React production build: `dist/`
- Electron main process and packaged app: `dist-electron/`
